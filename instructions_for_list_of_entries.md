To dynamically generate a list of entries in `_posts` and include it in your README as part of the Jekyll build process, you can utilize Jekyll's Liquid templating engine. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to achieve this:

### Step 1: Create a New File for the Posts List

First, create a new Markdown file where you'll store the generated list of posts. Let's call this file `_data/posts_list.md`.

### Step 2: Generate the Posts List

Next, you'll need to write a script that generates the list of posts and writes it to `_data/posts_list.md`. This script can be written in Ruby, as Jekyll is built on Ruby.

Create a file named `generate_posts_list.rb` in your project root (or another convenient location) with the following content:

```ruby
require 'fileutils'
require 'erb'

# Path to your posts directory
posts_dir = '_posts'

# Read all .md files in the posts directory
files = Dir.glob("#{posts_dir}/**/*.md")

# Extract the title and permalink from each file
posts_data = files.map do |file|
  title = File.basename(file).split('.')[0]
  permalink = File.join(posts_dir, File.basename(file))
  { title: title, permalink: permalink }
end

# Render the posts list to a string
template = ERB.new(File.read('_data/template.erb'))
posts_list = template.result(binding)

# Write the posts list to _data/posts_list.md
FileUtils.open('_data/posts_list.md', 'w') do |file|
  file.write(posts_list)
end
```

This script reads all Markdown files in the `_posts` directory, extracts the title and permalink for each post, and then uses an ERB template to format this data into a Markdown list.

### Step 3: Create the ERB Template

Create a file named `_data/template.erb` with the following content:

```markdown
{% for post in posts %}
- [{{ post.title }}]({{ post.permalink }})
{% endfor %}
```

This template iterates over each post and generates a Markdown-formatted list item with a link to the post.

### Step 4: Run the Script Before Building Your Site

Before building your Jekyll site, run the `generate_posts_list.rb` script. You can automate this by adding a step in your `Makefile` or `package.json` scripts, depending on your setup.

For example, if you're using npm scripts, you could add a step like this:

```json
"scripts": {
  "prebuild": "ruby generate_posts_list.rb && echo 'Generated posts list.'"
}
```

And then run `npm run prebuild` before building your site with `npm run build`.

### Step 5: Include the Posts List in Your README

Finally, include the generated list in your README by linking to the `_data/posts_list.md` file. Since Jekyll processes Markdown files, you can directly link to the file, and it will be converted to HTML during the build process.

Add the following line to your README:

```markdown
See our latest posts: [_posts_list](_data/posts_list.md)
```

This approach dynamically updates the list of posts in your README whenever you rebuild your Jekyll site, ensuring that your README always reflects the current state of your posts.
